* The client is expected to check for mistakes in rigging such as clipping, displacement of parts, and any general mistakes in rigging that are obvious and greatly lowers the quality of the model.
* The client is expected to respond with feedback within 48 hours of receiving updates. If any issue arises, please contact me asap. Try to be as detailed in feedback to avoid confusion. Many questions may come up for more clarity at this stage.
* Please do not micromanage.

Type of feedback not accepted:

* requests that out of my control, such as changing aspects of the artwork that is not done by me and/or without the permission of the original artist
* confusing changes without any clear ideas and reference, or proper direction
* being fickle with changes and causing many undos or redos of the rig

Refunds

* Full refunds are not offered unless cancelled by me due to unforeseen circumstances and/or unable to do it

* Up to 50% will be refunded if only the the mouth, eyes, head tilt, and body tilt are done
